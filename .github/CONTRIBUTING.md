# Contributing to Our Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/subodhjenasymbl/nebula-realtime-autopilot-js/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/subodhjenasymbl/nebula-realtime-autopilot-js/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `python build.py lint` for style unification
